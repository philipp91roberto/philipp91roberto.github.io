Welcome to my personal space on the web, a hub where passion for data science and the pursuit of innovation in ML and MLOps converge. I am Philipp Miotti, a data scientist with a rich academic background from ETH Zurich, where I honed my skills in Physics, specializing in Quantum Computing and Information Processing.

### My Expertise

My professional journey is characterized by a relentless drive to explore the depths of data analysis, machine learning, and the intricacies of deploying scalable solutions in complex environments. With a proven track record at Solargis and the Council for Budget Responsibility, I've designed and implemented cutting-edge data analysis pipelines, enhanced the reliability of meteorological and photovoltaic time series data, and contributed to the fiscal sustainability through predictive modeling.

Recent projects have seen me diving into the intricacies of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for Python-based projects, a testament to my commitment to enhancing efficiency and reliability in software deployment processes. Additionally, my work with Docker has allowed me to embrace the challenges and rewards of containerization, further solidifying my role in developing robust and scalable data solutions.

In the realm of cloud computing, my experience extends to deploying applications on AWS, utilizing services like ECS to achieve zero downtime deployments and enhance operational efficiency and scalability​​. This experience underlines my commitment to developing scalable solutions that not only meet but exceed the demands of modern data processing and analysis.

### My Journey

My journey in data science is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to innovate. Each project is an opportunity to tailor cutting-edge solutions to meet unique challenges, ensuring that I remain at the forefront of my field. Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration, communication, and the sharing of knowledge, principles that have guided my interactions and contributions to the data science community.

### Looking Ahead

As I continue on this path, my goal is to not only keep pace with the rapidly evolving tech landscape but to also serve as a beacon for others navigating the complexities of data science and MLOps. Through this blog, I aim to share insights, experiences, and lessons learned, hoping to inspire and empower fellow enthusiasts and professionals in their endeavors.
